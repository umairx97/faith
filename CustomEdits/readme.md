Here are some changes to be made in the node_modules files, I am aware that it is not the best but it is to have a quick result instead of creating a fully customized libraries.
For example the code inside the file "MessageImage.js" in the folder "GiftedChatLibrary" is to be copied and pasted into the file in this path:
"faithmeetslove/node_modules/react-native-gifted-chat/lib/MessageImage.js"
